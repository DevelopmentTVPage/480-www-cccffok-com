            "description": "Battle of Isengard (2nd Age)\nIsengard was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans in exile. Its location was at the north-western corner of Rohan, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions. Isengard was a green and pleasant place, with many large trees and grass fields, fed by the Angren. Orthanc stood in the exact centre\nDuring the early Third Age the land of Calenardhon became depopulated, and the last warden of Orthanc was recalled to Minas Tirith. Isengard remained guarded by a small company, led by a hereditary captain. Bit by bit though the messages from Minas Tirith decreased until they ceased altogether.\nAfter Calenardhon was given to the \u00c9oth\u00e9od by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, and became Rohan, Isengard was the sole fortress retained by Gondor north of the Ered Nimrais (excluding An\u00f3rien), although Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the fortress became Dunlending in all but name. Orthanc however remained closed, as the Steward of Gondor alone held the keys.\nBy 2710 the line of hereditary Captains died out and during the rule of Rohan's King D\u00e9or it was evident that Isengard had become openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Isengard as their base, the Dunlendings continued to raid Rohan during D\u00e9or's son Gram's rule, until during the rule of Gram's son Helm Hammerhand a Dunlending Lord, Freca and his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim destroyed the invaders and blockaded Isengard.\nThis battle is the battle of helm hammerhand vs the dunlending tribes as they try to regain this ancient stronghold. The dunlending dont have access to Orthanc tower[Gondor still has the keys] but there expulsion from the area is critical .\nPostscript : After the battle , a more permanent solution was now needed for Isengard, as Gondor did not wish to relinquish its claim to one of the Towers of the Realm, but at the same time lacked the strength or inclination to garrison it. A solution presented itself to the Steward of Gondor, Beren, as Saruman the White suddenly reappeared from the East, and he offered to guard Isengard. Beren gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc, and Saruman settled there. However at first he resided there as Warden of the Tower on behalf of Gondor. After him the valley became known as Nan Curun\u00edr, or \"Valley of the Wizard\". In 2953, taking advantage of Sauron's return and the resulting distraction of the Stewards, Saruman took Isengard for himself and became Lord of Isengard\n\nDownload the Battle here!:\nSinglePlayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/qne9oal9x89df68\/isengard_helm_SP.rar\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/g53yi2lq5kxdgn7\/isengard_helm_MP.rar\n\nHistorygeneral's Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCHZo41Tcup462PHa8DUGW8w\n\nIf you enjoyed the video don't forget to Like and Leave a comment :D\n\n----------------------------------How You Can Support Me! ------------------------------------\n\n- Like, share and leave a comment :D\n- Turn OFF adblock or whitelist my channel\n- Send me a GREAT battle Replay: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n\n------------------------------------------Connect With Me!-------------------------------------------\n\n- Email: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\n- Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/PixelatedApollo\n- Steam Group:  http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/apollosknights\n- Twitch: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/pixelatedapollo\n- TeamSpeak: thewarcamp.vortexservers.com:10124",
