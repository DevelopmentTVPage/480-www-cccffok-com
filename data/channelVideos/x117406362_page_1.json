                "description": "This is my first look at Kingdom Come: Deliverance, developed by Warhorse Studios.  It's a RPG based on historical events in Medieval Europe.  Deliverance is currently under development and is in closed Alpha.  The game focuses on historical environments, quest, Alchemy, and most importantly fighting.

And in most cases whoever sends in the battle replay wins the battle.  So I block it to keep it a surprise :D  \n\n_\n\nConnect With me!\n\nEmail: pixelatedapollo@gmail.com\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/PixelatedApollo\nSteam Group:  http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/apollosknights\nTwitch: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/pixelatedapollo\nTeamSpeak: thewarcamp.vortexservers.com:10124",
