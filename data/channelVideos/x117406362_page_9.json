            "description": "Battle of Bannockburn 1314 AD -\n\nThe time is 24 June 1314 and the English King Edward II has marched to relieve Stirling Castle which is besieged by Edward Bruce.\n\nEdward II of England came to the throne in 1307 but was incapable of providing the determined leadership that had been shown by his father, Edward I, and the English position soon became more difficult. Stirling Castle was one of the most important castles that was held by the English as it commanded the route north into the Scottish Highlands. It was besieged in 1314 by Robert the Bruce's brother, Edward Bruce, and an agreement was made that if the castle was not relieved by mid-summer then it would be surrendered to the Scots.\n\nThe English could not ignore this challenge and military preparations were made for a substantial campaign in which the English army probably numbered 2,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, many of whom would have been longbowmen. The Scottish army probably numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 men, of whom no more than 500 would have been mounted. Unlike the heavily armoured English cavalry, the Scottish cavalry would have been light horsemen who were good for skirmishing and reconnaissance but were not suitable for charging the enemy lines. The Scottish infantry would have had axes, swords and pikes, with few bowmen among them.\n\nEdward II and his advisors were aware of the places that the Scots were likely to challenge them and sent out orders for their troops to prepare for an enemy established in boggy ground near to the River Forth, near Stirling. The English appear to have advanced in four divisions whereas the Scots were in three divisions, known as 'schiltrons' which were strong defensive circles of men bristling with pikes. Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, commanded the Scottish vanguard, which was stationed about a mile to the south of Stirling, near the church of St. Ninian, while the king commanded the rearguard at the entrance to the New Park. His brother Edward led the third division. According to Barbour, there was a fourth division nominally under the youthful Walter the Steward, but actually under the command of Sir James Douglas.\n\nOn 23 June 1314,[first day of battle] two of the English cavalry formations advanced, the first commanded by the Earl of Gloucester and the Earl of Hereford and where counted by scottish cav under the command of robert bruce themselves..unable to clearly push throught to the castle , the english readied for the second day , crossing the stream under nightfall . Not long after daybreak, the Scots spearmen began to move towards the English. Edward was surprised to see Robert's army emerge from the cover of the woods. As Bruce's army drew nearer, they paused and knelt in prayer. Edward is supposed to have said in surprise \"They pray for mercy!\" \"For mercy, yes,\" one of his attendants replied, \"But from God, not you. These men will conquer or die.\" . The English answered with a cavalry charge of there own and the battle was joined.\n\nCan the Scots find the courage to win against the odds against the mighty war machine that is england....?\n\nI can't get Robert of Bruce as Commander for scots ..so i picked Edward[his brother[ as a suitable name..forgive me :D]\n\nActual result :- Few accompanied Gloucester in his charge and when he reached the Scottish lines he was quickly surrounded and killed. Gradually the English were pushed back and ground down by the Scots' schiltrons. The English longbowmen attempted to support the advance of the knights but were ordered to cease fire as they were causing casualties among their own. An attempt to employ the English and Welsh longbowmen to shoot at the advancing Scots from their flank failed when they were dispersed by the Scottish 500-horse light cavalry under the Marischal Sir Robert Keith The English cavalry was hemmed in making it difficult for them to manoeuvre. As a result, the English were unable to hold their formations and broke ranks.\n\nPlay the Battle:\nhttp:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/nmf56nmf3ydix1j\/bannockburn_Pain.rar\n\nSources and Links to Videos Used:\nBattle of Bannockburn: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wRNx5awMOPk\nMonty Python and The Holy Grail: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GsKDg7Y28D8\nBattle reenactment: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9N1-NDhccxI\n_\nHow to send me Battle Replays!\n\nThis video will show you how to send me battle replays :D https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7nG3uZoDkCU\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to play Medieval 2 Total War & Rome Total War Online!\n\nGamespy Servers are down, but there is still hope.

            "description": "Another Historical Battle in Third Age!  If you enjoyed the video don't forget to leave a comment and a Like :D\n\nBattle of Dol Guldur 3019TA -\n\nThe forces of the Galadrim with help from the Ents and some help from rohan have resisted the attempt of the forces of Sauron to destroy the elves of Lothlorien.Four times they were attacked and in each the mighty elves [with sometimes the help of allies] have driven back the forces of darkness. But in every battle there is a moment to counter and the time is now ....\n\n So then on March 28, Celeborn led many Elves from Lothl\u00f3rien across the river Anduin in a fleet of boats. The elves invaded. When they reached Dol Guldur, a defense had already been prepared and the siege endured some days. The usual guardians, the Nazg\u00fbl, were gone, and the forces from Dol Guldur prepared to counter the enemy forces of the elves with wargs and spiders collected from the forest of mirkwood at a last attempt to throw back the forces of the elves.\n\nBut Galadriel herself is said to also be bringing her magic to bear on the mighty fortress....can the elves under Celeborn , Haldir and Radagast destroy the orcs or will the magic of the elves have to be brought forth once again to destroy the guardians of the evil fortress....\n\naftermath : When the fortress was surrounded, Galadriel slowly walked to the fortified gate of the fortress. Orcish arrows flew about her, yet her Elven Ring protected her. With a gentle push from her ladyship, the gates swung forward and Galadriel with her ring cast down the walls, foul pits, crevices, caused grasses, and fruit trees to grow. The evil realm of Dol Guldur was finally destroyed. Galadriel caused an Elanor flower to grow in the middle of the old fortress. The forest was cleansed. \n\nOn April 6, Celeborn and King Thranduil met in the midst of the forest and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen \"wood of green leaves\". Celeborn took the land south of The Narrows for himself and named it East L\u00f3rien, while Thranduil took all wood north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, and they gave the middle of the wood to the Beornings and Woodmen.\n\nPlay the Battle -\n\nSingleplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/5fwcec1wplmvc7f\/dol_guldur_sp.rar\n\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/vpuw6cc9l6db53e\/dol_guldur_mpv3.rar\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.

If you enjoyed the video don't forget to leave a comment and a Like :D\n\nBattle of Dol Guldur 3019TA -\n\nThe forces of the Galadrim with help from the Ents and some help from rohan have resisted the attempt of the forces of Sauron to destroy the elves of Lothlorien.Four times they were attacked and in each the mighty elves [with sometimes the help of allies] have driven back the forces of darkness. But in every battle there is a moment to counter and the time is now ....\n\n So then on March 28, Celeborn led many Elves from Lothl\u00f3rien across the river Anduin in a fleet of boats. The elves invaded. When they reached Dol Guldur, a defense had already been prepared and the siege endured some days. The usual guardians, the Nazg\u00fbl, were gone, and the forces from Dol Guldur prepared to counter the enemy forces of the elves with wargs and spiders collected from the forest of mirkwood at a last attempt to throw back the forces of the elves.\n\nBut Galadriel herself is said to also be bringing her magic to bear on the mighty fortress....can the elves under Celeborn , Haldir and Radagast destroy the orcs or will the magic of the elves have to be brought forth once again to destroy the guardians of the evil fortress....\n\naftermath : When the fortress was surrounded, Galadriel slowly walked to the fortified gate of the fortress. Orcish arrows flew about her, yet her Elven Ring protected her. With a gentle push from her ladyship, the gates swung forward and Galadriel with her ring cast down the walls, foul pits, crevices, caused grasses, and fruit trees to grow. The evil realm of Dol Guldur was finally destroyed. Galadriel caused an Elanor flower to grow in the middle of the old fortress. The forest was cleansed. \n\nOn April 6, Celeborn and King Thranduil met in the midst of the forest and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen \"wood of green leaves\". Celeborn took the land south of The Narrows for himself and named it East L\u00f3rien, while Thranduil took all wood north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, and they gave the middle of the wood to the Beornings and Woodmen.\n\nPlay the Battle -\n\nSingleplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/5fwcec1wplmvc7f\/dol_guldur_sp.rar\n\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/vpuw6cc9l6db53e\/dol_guldur_mpv3.rar\n_\nVisit my Website & Podcast!\n\nThanks to this awesome community I built a website for Total War fans, gamers, and history nerds.
