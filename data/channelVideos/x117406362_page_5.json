The Danes wish to fight a fair line battle on land and the Earl would be wise to give them their wish or they will board their ships and raid further down the coast before his men can help them.\nThe Earl considers the matter and agrees ..The englishmen withdraw up the beach allowing the norsemen to form up and a major battle is fought out.\n\nPostscript : Unfortunately the battle did not go well for the English , the Earl it is said may have been felled by a poison spear and the defenders when he fell, mostly ran ..with some stout folk remaining fighting over his body.His Body was later recovered and buried at Ely Cathedral [where some archaeologists have checked the size of his skeleton and confirmed his height]\nIt is also thought that Brithnoth's widow, Aethelflaed, presented the abbey with \"a curtain woven and depicted with the deeds of her husband as a memorial of his virtue\", and this may have inspired the idea for the later Bayeux Tapestry commemorating the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\n\nAfter the battle a monk from a nearby church noted the battle in old english script which became known as the \"Poem of The Battle of Maldon\" which has been translated and can be viewed :P Such ancient transcripts attracted many scholars, one in particular was J.R.R Tolkien who added his own sequel \"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son\" which was published in 1953 .\n\nThe forces for the battle are unclear but a possible 2-4,000 vikings are thought to be possible with around 96 viking ships or so ....The viking leader in some sources is thought to Anlaf, in others ,Olaf Tryggvason. After the battle Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury and the aldermen of the south-western provinces advised King Aethelred to buy off the Vikings rather than continue the armed struggle.
