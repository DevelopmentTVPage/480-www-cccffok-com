            "description": "Battle of Khazad-d\u00fbm\nIn SA 40 after the fall of Beleriand in the War of Wrath and the Dwarves of Nogrod had left Middle-earth, the city was enriched in numbers, smithing, crafting, and masonry. These factors ever strengthened Khazad-d\u00fbm and brought prosperity to their city.  \nWith the fall of Beleriand in the north, the \u00d1oldor looked for a new land to call home. They founded the land west of Moria, Eregion. A rare friendship sprang up between the Elves and the Dwarves of this new land, and they each aided each other in constructing the magical Western-gate of Moria, and went so far that they even presented King Durin lll with a lesser Ring of Power. The bond between Khazad-d\u00fbm and Eregion suddenly came to end as, in SA 1697, the Dark Lord Sauron corrupted the country of the elves, and despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to help them, he succeeded in destroying the fair land driving away all the elves. At this time the Doors of Durin were flung shut and sealed against Sauron's forces, and Khazad-d\u00fbm began a long seclusion from the outside world. It was at this time that the Orcs invaded Mount Gundabad, taking it from the Kingdom of Durin for themselves. \nTheir seclusion was broken for a time at the beginning of the War of the Last Alliance. Led by Durin IV, the Dwarves fought alongside the Elves and Men in their campaign to defeat Sauron for the last time. Winning the battle, the Dwarves returned to their long seclusion from the world inside Moria.\nThroughout the beginning of the Third Age, the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm expanded its treasure, but its numbers began to dwindle.

                "description": "Battle of Khazad-d\u00fbm\nIn SA 40 after the fall of Beleriand in the War of Wrath and the Dwarves of Nogrod had left Middle-earth, the city was enriched in numbers, smithing, crafting, and masonry. These factors ever strengthened Khazad-d\u00fbm and brought prosperity to their city.  \nWith the fall of Beleriand in the north, the \u00d1oldor looked for a new land to call home. They founded the land west of Moria, Eregion. A rare friendship sprang up between the Elves and the Dwarves of this new land, and they each aided each other in constructing the magical Western-gate of Moria, and went so far that they even presented King Durin lll with a lesser Ring of Power. The bond between Khazad-d\u00fbm and Eregion suddenly came to end as, in SA 1697, the Dark Lord Sauron corrupted the country of the elves, and despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to help them, he succeeded in destroying the fair land driving away all the elves. At this time the Doors of Durin were flung shut and sealed against Sauron's forces, and Khazad-d\u00fbm began a long seclusion from the outside world. It was at this time that the Orcs invaded Mount Gundabad, taking it from the Kingdom of Durin for themselves. \nTheir seclusion was broken for a time at the beginning of the War of the Last Alliance. Led by Durin IV, the Dwarves fought alongside the Elves and Men in their campaign to defeat Sauron for the last time. Winning the battle, the Dwarves returned to their long seclusion from the world inside Moria.\nThroughout the beginning of the Third Age, the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm expanded its treasure, but its numbers began to dwindle. The majority of their wealth was based on their hoards of Mithril of which they mined in their deepest tunnels, and as the centuries went by the Dwarves delved ever deeper for the precious metal.  \nIn TA 1980, King Durin VI had reports that the miners had opened up a new cavern system in the caverns below....Strange noises and drums were heard in the deep,scouting parties are sent to the deep,but none return...Several weeks later when receiving a trade delegation from the elves and men...2 massive armies of orcs and goblins moved to besiege the great dwarven fortress blocking both exits .....The dwarves readied there defences and called for more troops from the outer caverns and asked for aid from the elfven & men delegations...but still the goblins and orcs did not attack.....when suddenly there was the sound of drums from the deep, and some of the orc armies started to move....\n\nDwarven Royal Guard[King Durin played by ATTILA(HUN=TURK)\n====================================================\n1 dwarven noblemen\n1 Guard of khazad-dum\n2 dwarven miners\n1 Iron guard\n2 Iron crossbowmen\n1 Ballista\n1 Cata\n2 vault warden\n1 dwarven halberdmen\n\nDwarven Guard[Captain Fundin played by Arrow2daknee]\n=============================================\n1 dwarven noblemen[gen]\n2 vault warden\n1 dwarven halberdmen\n3 iron crossbowmen\n1 Cata\n1 Ballista\n2 Dwarven warriors\n1 Iron Guard\n\nDwarven Reserves[Captain Nain played by longbow -15min]\n==============================================\n1 Dwarven noblemen[gen]\n1 Axemen of Erebor\n1 Dragonslayers of Ered-Mithil\n1 Iron guard\n1 Dwarven warriors\n1 Dwarven miners\n1 Dwarven axemen\n1 sylvan heavy archers\n1 Elder spearmen\n1 Dale swordsmen\n\nOrcs of Gundabad\n==============\nMain force[Captain Gorgaz played by dj0419]\n======================================\n1 orc bodyguard [gen]\n2 Cave trolls\n2 Snaga skirmishers\n4 Goblin band\n4 orc fellers\n4 orc halberdiers\n2 cata\n1 goblin trackers\n\n2nd force[captain yagbug played by yankee spots]\n=========================================\n1 orc bodyguard[gen]\n2 cave trolls\n1 warg riders\n4 goblin band\n2 orc halberdiers\n4 orc fellers\n\nOrcs of misty mountain\n===================\n\n1st invasion force[Captain Muzluk played by StorM]\n========================================\n1 Orc bodyguard[Gen]\n4 Heavy goblin infantry\n4 Heavy goblin halberd\n2 cata\n2 cave trolls\n1 heavy goblin archer\n6 goblin infantry\n\n2nd invasion force[Captain Nuzu played by Mr Deluxe Penguin]\n=================================================\n1 Orc Bodyguard[gen]\n2 heavy goblin infantry\n2 heavy goblin halberd\n1 cave troll\n9 goblin infantry\n2 snaga skirmishers\n1 Cata\n\nInvasion force from the deep[Captain Balrog by paladinbob]\n=================================================\nOrc bodyguard[Gen] which is Balrog on single player\n6 Experienced Heavy Goblin infantry\n\nDownload the Battle Here:\nSingleplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/rxfpwll2aj6nvs7\/dwarf_khazad3_sp.rar\nMultiplayer: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/download\/1cl911fzbyrjaw3\/dwarf_khazad3_mpv2.rar",
